good:
2
4 12345
2 123

regex:
1)      \s*(?P<T>\d+)\s*
2-T)    \s*(?P<L1>\d+)\s+(?P<L2>\d+)\s*

regex with list abstraction:
1)      {0} \d+ {1}
2-T)    {0} \d+ {2} with delimiter '\s+'

assumptions:
T > 0
L1 + 1 > len(L2)

regex with list abstraction and assumptions:
1)      line1 = {0} int, > 0 {1}
2-T)    line2 = {0} int, len(THIS) > line2[1] + 1 {1} int {2} with delimiter '\s+'

bad:

python: ValueError (invalid base 10 for '4 12345')
ERROR: the first line must consist of one number only but found two numbers
1) line doesn't match \s*(?P<T>\d+)\s*
2) should only be one element with (\d+) with strip()

python: ValueError (not enough values to unpack: expected 2, got 1)
ERROR: the second line must consist of two numbers separated by whitespaces but found only one
1) line doesn't match \s*(?P<LS>\d+)\s+(?P<LD>\d+)\s*
2) split() line, first element is (\d+), second element doesn't match (\d+)
3) ==> second element isn't number but ''
---COMMENT: if number of elements is not right there might be something wrong with delimiter, so mention delimiter in this case:
1) line doesn't match \s*(?P<LS>\d+)\s+(?P<LD>\d+)\s*
2) line does not have 2 elements when using delimiter
3) ==> expected two numbers separated by whitespaces but only found one: '4'
---COMMENT: how much information should be use?
    1) expected two elements separated by whitespaces but only found one
    2) expected two numbers separated by whitespaces but only found one
    3) expected two numbers separated by whitespaces but only found one and second one also has to be ...
    ---COMMENT: won't work, cannot know if '4' is first or second element. but maybe already tell what first and second element should look like?:
    3) expected two numbers separated by whitespaces but only found one and first one should be ... and second one also has to be ...
    ---COMMENT: but maybe too much information and you shouldn't tell user something that he might not have done wrong (maybe only second element forgotton)
                other idea is to make information available if needed like button with "show more information about values" and then also information about values is shown

python: IndexError (string index our of range)
ERROR: the first number in the second line + 1 must be smaller than the number of digits of the second number
but (8+1) is bigger than 5
1) line matches \s*(?P<L1>\d+)\s+(?P<L2>\d+)\s*
    ==> line structure ok but maybe some assumptions are violated
2) get elements with L1, L2
    ==> L1 + 1 < len(L2)
3) ==> L1 (8) + 1 < len(12345) is violated

---COMMENT: need way to tell user that delimiter is wrong: first element is not number but '4,12345', expected are two number separated by whitespace
---COMMENT: maybe show regex if user wants to see
