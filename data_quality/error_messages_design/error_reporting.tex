\section{Error Checking Algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}
\item check for number of elements
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|{0} T {len}? with delimiter ','| --$>$ number unknown, nothing to check
\item \verb|{0} T {3} with delimiter ','| --$>$ exactly 3 elements
\item \verb|{0} T {3} T {len}? with delimiter ','| --$>$ at least 3 elements
\item \verb|{0} T {2} ({0} T {2} T {len}? with delimiter '>') {3} T {len}? with delimiter ','| --$>$ at least 3 elements and third element has to have at least 2 elements
\end{itemize}
\item check type and structure of elements
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|{0} int {len}? with delimiter ','| --$>$ all have to be int
\item \verb|{0} int {3} with delimiter ','| --$>$ all have to be int
\item \verb|{0} int {3} T {len}? with delimiter ','| --$>$ elements [0:3] have to be int
\item \verb;{0} T {1} (...13|...17) {2} T {len}? with delimiter ','; --$>$ element [1] has to look like regex
\end{itemize}
\item check additional constraints
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|{0} int, >0 {len}? with delimiter ','| --$>$ all have to be $>$0
\item \verb|{0} int, >0 {3} with delimiter ','| --$>$ all have to be $>$0
\item \verb|{0} int, >0 {3} T {len}? with delimiter ','| --$>$ elements [0:3] have to be $>$0
\end{itemize}
\item TODO: need some means to fill relational constraints
\item check additional relational constraints
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|{0} int, >L1[0] {len}? with delimiter ','| --$>$ all have to be $>$(first element of line 1)
\item \verb|{0} int {1} int, >L[0] {3} with delimiter ','| --$>$ elements [1:3] $>$(first element of this line)
\item \verb|{0} int, >L[2] {1} int {3} T {len}? with delimiter ','| --$>$ element 0 has to be $>$(third element of this line)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Kind of Messages}

\begin{itemize}


\item \textit{expected X elements separated by DELIMITER, instead found Y elements (EXAMPLE)}

if number of elements is not correct

list abstraction: \verb|line = {0} int {3} with delimiter ','|

problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item empty (might be ok?): '' --$>$ line has wrong number of elements when splitted by ',' --$>$ expected 3 numbers separated by comma, instead found 1 element ('')
\item wrong delimiter: '1 2 3' --$>$ line has wrong number of elements when splitted by ',' --$>$ expected 3 numbers separated by comma, instead found 1 element ('1 2 3')
\item not a number: '1,2' --$>$ line has wrong number of elements when splitted by ',' --$>$ expected 3 numbers separated by comma, instead found 2 elements ('1', '2')
\item not a number: '1,2,3,a,5,6' --$>$ line has wrong number of elements when splitted by ',' --$>$ expected 3 numbers separated by comma, instead found 6 elements ('1', '2', '3', 'a', '5','6')
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{expected at least X elements separated by DELIMITER, instead found only Y elements (EXAMPLE)}

list abstraction: \verb|line = {0} int {3} T {len} with delimiter ','|

problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item empty (might be ok?): '' --$>$ line has wrong number of elements when splitted by ',' --$>$ expected at least 3 numbers separated by comma, instead found only 1 element ('')
\item wrong delimiter: '1 2 3' --$>$ line has wrong number of elements when splitted by ',' --$>$ expected at least 3 numbers separated by comma, instead found only 1 element ('1 2 3')
\item not a number: '1,2' --$>$ line has wrong number of elements when splitted by ',' --$>$ expected at least 3 numbers separated by comma, instead found only 2 elements ('1', '2')
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{expected numbers separated by DELIMITER, instead found EXAMPLE}

if number of values is not known, but we know it should be numbers

list abstraction: \verb|line = {0} int {len} with delimiter ','|

problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item empty (might be ok?): '' --$>$ line[0] is not a number when splitted by ',' --$>$ expected numbers separated by comma, instead found ''
\item wrong delimiter: '1 2 3' --$>$ line[0] is not a number when splitted by ',' --$>$ expected numbers separated by comma, instead found '1 2 3'
\item not a number: '1,2,3,a,5,6' --$>$ line[3] is not a number when splitted by ',' --$>$ expected numbers separated by comma, instead found 'a'
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{a TYPE is expected, instead found EXAMPLE}

if number of elements is correct but type it not

list abstraction: \verb|line = {0} int {3} with delimiter ','|

problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item not a number: '1,2,a' --$>$ line[2] is not a number when splitted by ',' --$>$ a number is expected, instead found 'a'
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{value X has to be COMPARISON than value CONSTANT, but EXAMPLE\_X is not COMPARISON than value CONSTANT}

\item \textit{value X has to be COMPARISON than value Y, but EXAMPLE\_X is not COMPARISON than value EXAMPLE\_Y}

information of value Y is needed. 

should the information be shown for both values? --$>$ if the checker is interactive then it is shown for the first value and if the values gets corrected it should not be shown for the second one. --$>$ if the errors are shown in a 'list' then we should show the message at both values and remove both error messages as soon as one value is corrected

\item \textit{value X has to be COMPARISON than the number of values starting from the Yth value, but EXAMPLE\_X is not COMPARISON than value EXAMPLE\_LEN(Y)}

a button could show the example for the values that were found for Y, there might be a lot so it doesn't make sense to directly show it in the error message but the information might still be useful to the user

\item \textit{value X has to be COMPARISON than the number of lines starting from the Yth line, but EXAMPLE\_X is not COMPARISON than value EXAMPLE\_LEN(Y)}

same as above

\end{itemize}

\section{Examples}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{line is one integer}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{but got: ''}

Message: line is expected to be one number, instead found ''

\item \textit{but got: 'a'}

Message: line is expected to be one number, instead found 'a'

\item \textit{but got: '1 2'}

Message: line is expected to be one number, instead found '1 2'
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{line is two integer separated by whitespaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{but got: ''}

Message: line is expected to be two numbers separated by whitespaces, instead found ''

\item \textit{but got: 'a'}

Message: line is expected to be two numbers separated by whitespaces, instead found 'a'

\item \textit{but got: '1'}

Message: line is expected to be two numbers separated by whitespaces, but found one numbers

\item \textit{but got: '1 2 3'}

Message: line is expected to be two numbers separated by whitespaces, but found three numbers

\item \textit{but got: '1,2'}

Message: line is expected to be two numbers separated by whitespaces, instead found '1,2'

\item \textit{but got: '1 a'}

Message: line is expected to be two numbers separated by whitespaces, instead found 'a'
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{line is integers separated by whitespaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{but got: 'a'}

Message: line is expected to be numbers separated by whitespaces, instead found 'a'

\item \textit{but got: '1,2,3,4,5,6'}

Message: line is expected to be numbers separated by whitespaces, instead found '1,2,3,4,5,6'

\item \textit{but got: '1 2 3 4 5 a'}

Message: line is expected to be numbers separated by whitespaces, instead found 'a'
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{line is numbers separated by whitespaces and first integer > 10}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{but got: '1 2 3 4'}

Message: first number in line has to be greater than 10, but 1 is not greater than 10
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{line is numbers separated by whitespaces and first number should be smaller or equal to the number of integers that follow}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{but got: '1 2 3 4'}

Message: first number in line has to be smaller or equal to the number of elements in the line starting from the second one, but 1 is not smaller or equal to 3 ('2','3','4')

\item \textit{but got: ''}

---COMMENT: need information if line can be empty! otherwise should also have assumption that there should be at least one number!

\item \textit{but got: '1'}

Message: first number in line has to be smaller or equal to number of elements in the line starting from the second one, but 1 is not smaller or equal to 0 ()
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{first line in file has to be smaller or equal to the lines that follow}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{but got: '3' and '1' and '1'}

Message: first number in file has to be smaller or equal to the number of lines starting from the second one, but 3 is not smaller or equal to 2 ('1', '1')
---COMMENT: showing lines or elements in error message only works if there are not too many elements. maybe better to have a button that give more information about what was found.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
